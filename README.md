## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that powers the dynamic behavior on most websites. This repository documents my journey as I learn and apply various JavaScript concepts, from the basics to more advanced topics.

## Core Concepts

### Variables and Data Types
- **Variables**: \`var\`, \`let\`, \`const\` and their scopes.
- **Data Types**: Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Null, Undefined, Symbols, and Objects.

### Functions
- **Function Declarations vs. Expressions**: Understanding the difference.
- **Arrow Functions**: A more concise syntax.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.

### Loops and Iterations
- **for Loop**: Traditional loop for running a code block multiple times.
- **while Loop**: Continues as long as a condition is true.
- **forEach, map, filter**: Iterating over arrays in functional programming style.

### Conditional Statements
- **if-else**: Basic conditional logic.
- **switch-case**: Handling multiple conditions.
- **Ternary Operator**: Shorthand for \`if-else\`.

### Arrays and Objects
- **Arrays**: Storing and manipulating lists of data.
- **Objects**: Key-value pairs for more complex data structures.
- **Destructuring**: Extracting data from arrays and objects.
  
### Scope and Closures
- **Scope**: Global vs. local scope.
- **Closures**: Functions that "remember" their lexical environment.

### Asynchronous JavaScript
- **Callbacks**: Functions passed as arguments.
- **Promises**: Handling asynchronous operations.
- **async/await**: A more readable way to work with promises.

### ES6+ Features
- **Template Literals**: Embedding expressions in strings.
- **Destructuring Assignment**: Unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects.
- **Modules**: Importing and exporting code.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects Iâ€™ve built to practice my JavaScript skills:

1. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**: A simple command-line game implemented using basic JavaScript concepts.
2. **To-Do List**: A dynamic to-do list application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks.
3. **Weather App**: Fetching data from an API and displaying the weather of a user-input location.
4. **JavaScript Calculator**: A basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Conclusion

This is an ongoing project, and Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and sharing more about JavaScript. Feel free to explore the repository, use the code, and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!

Happy Coding! ðŸŽ‰
